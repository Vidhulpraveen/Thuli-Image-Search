# Image Search App

**Objective:**

This project aims to create a web application that allows users to enter a prompt in a text box. The application will then utilize the Unsplash API to search for and retrieve relevant images based on the entered prompt. For instance, if a user inputs "nature," the app will return various nature images from Unsplash.

**Features:**

- Prompt Input: A text box where users can type their desired search term.
- Image Retrieval: Integration with the Unsplash API to fetch images corresponding to the user's prompt.
- Image Preview: Users can preview the retrieved images within the application.
- Social Media Sharing: Options to share the selected images on various social media platforms.
